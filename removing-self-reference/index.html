      </p>
      <p class="commentary">
        The original version is more likely to provoke negative emotions because it is deeply personal, immersive, and raw. The first-person perspective makes it intimate, as though the emotions are being lived through in real-time. The direct self-references intensify these feelings, making it harder to detach from the sadness and longing being expressed.

        The bygone days of the Viking era, North Korean communist fantasies, the freshness of Hong Kong's air—<span class="added">each one a spell to distract from the present condition</span>. The air does not taste good here, in <span class="added">the mind</span>. When the thought surfaces accidentally, sadness follows so sharply that any means necessary are used to suppress the longing. <span class="added">The mind travels</span>—to 1950s America, to North Korea, to Hong Kong, to faraway places—just to escape <span class="added">itself</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="commentary">
        The rewritten version keeps much of the style and content but removes direct personal pronouns to establish distance from the emotion. It shifts from an immediate, first-person experience to a more observational tone, reducing the intensity of negative feelings. This slight depersonalization allows for a more reflective or intellectual engagement, rather than a purely visceral response.
